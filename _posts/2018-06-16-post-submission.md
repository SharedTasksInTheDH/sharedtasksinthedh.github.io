As of this morning, the deadline has passed, and submissions are no longer allowed. In total, **we received eight submissions**, i.e., eight groups have contributed annotation guidelines. This is awesome.

To provide some very basic statistics:

### By country

50% of the submissions are from Germany, the others are from Canada, Ireland, Sweden, and the U.S.

### By group size

| Group size  | Number | 
| ---:| ---:|
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 1 | 
| 4 | 1 |

Three submissions are the result of activities in a class/seminar, these  obviously contain contributions by a lot more people.
