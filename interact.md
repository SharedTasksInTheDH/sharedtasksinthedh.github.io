## Spread the Word

<div style="float:right;margin-left:20px;"><img style="border-radius:0" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/generic/qr.png" /></div>

The entire idea depends on a large enough community interested in participating. Please help spread the word in your community, e.g., by pointing potentially interested researchers to this website. A short URL for this web page is [`http://tinyurl.com/stdighum`](http://tinyurl.com/stdighum). Alternatively, you can use this QR code:

## Reach us

There are multiple ways to contact us for any kind of feedback, questions or contributions.

### GitHub Issues

Any kind of feedback is best left on github as an [issue](https://github.com/SharedTasksInTheDH/sharedtasksinthedh.github.io/issues), we plan to use github as a primary means of communication throughout the shared tasks.

### E-Mail

Please send e-mails to [Nils](mailto:nils.reiter@ims.uni-stuttgart.de?subject=Shared Tasks in the Digital Humanities) for the moment. We will set up a mailing list soonish.
