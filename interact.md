## Participate

Please register for [our email list: `sharedtasksinthedh@listserv.uni-stuttgart.de`](https://listserv.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/sharedtasksinthedh). The list serves both as a registration and communication tool, in all directions.


## Spread the Word

<div style="float:right;margin-left:20px;"><img style="border-radius:0" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/generic/qr.png" /></div>

The entire idea depends on a large enough community interested in participating. Please help spread the word in your community, e.g., by pointing potentially interested researchers to this website. A short URL for this web page is [`http://tinyurl.com/stdighum`](http://tinyurl.com/stdighum). Alternatively, you can use this QR code:

<div style="float:left;margin-right:20px;"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/generic/Flyer_2017-04-24.pdf"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/generic/Flyer_2017-04-24_thumb.png" /></a></div>
### Flyer


For easier distribution, we have created a [flyer]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/generic/Flyer_2017-04-24.pdf) that contains the most important facts. Feel free to share it in whatever way you like. 

<div style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>


### GitHub Issues

Any kind of feedback is best left on github as an [issue](https://github.com/SharedTasksInTheDH/sharedtasksinthedh.github.io/issues), we plan to use github as a primary means of communication throughout the shared tasks.
