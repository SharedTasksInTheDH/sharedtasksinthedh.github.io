There are multiple ways to contact us for any kind of feedback, questions or contributions

## GitHub Issues

Any kind of feedback is best left on github as an [issue](https://github.com/SharedTasksInTheDH/sharedtasksinthedh.github.io/issues), we plan to use github as a primary means of communication throughout the shared tasks.

## E-Mail

Please send e-mails to [Nils](mailto:nils.reiter@ims.uni-stuttgart.de).
