## Why work on narrative levels?
First, its relatively frequent, and also frequently decidable (while focalisation, for instance, is only rarely marked). Second, it is ubiquituous: Most narrative texts and even many non-fiction texts (e.g., longer pieces in magazines) contain multiple narrative levels. There is even a TV series that uses narrative levels as a major plot device. Third: We believe that switches between narrative levels can be detected automatically to some extent.
