## Why work on narrative levels?
First, its relatively frequent, and also frequently decidable (while focalisation, for instance, is only rarely marked). Second, it is ubiquituous: Most narrative texts and even many non-fiction texts (e.g., longer pieces in magazines) contain multiple narrative levels. There is even a TV series that uses narrative levels as a major plot device. Third: We believe that switches between narrative levels can be detected automatically to some extent.

## What is a shared task?
Shared tasks are a workshop framework popular in natural language processing (NLP). In NLP, different participant teams develop systems that all solve the same task. Due to previously set standards and evaluation data sets, the performance results are directly comparable. This gives insight which systems are able to solve a task.
